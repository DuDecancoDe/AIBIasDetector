# AI Bias Detector Static Site

This folder contains the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the AI Bias Detector, ready for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About page
- `analyze.html` — Analyze page (with real JS-based bias analysis)

## Deployment
1. Push the contents of the `static_site` folder to your GitHub repository.

3. Visit your GitHub Pages URL to view the site.
